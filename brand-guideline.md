## 1) Brand Foundation

### 1.1 One‑liner
Proof-of-understanding for every video.

### 1.2 Elevator pitch (external)
LearnStamp turns video watching into verifiable learning. Viewers answer timestamped micro‑quizzes at moments that matter; correct answers mint non‑transferable proof‑of‑understanding on U2U. The crowd refines the best questions. Creators see confusion hotspots, pass rates, and concept graphs—fueling better content and community.

### 1.3 Boilerplate (press, footer)
LearnStamp is a social learning layer for video. With timestamped micro‑quizzes and non‑transferable on‑chain stamps on U2U, it provides portable, verifiable proof‑of‑understanding for learners and analytics for creators. Learn together—and prove it.

### 1.4 Positioning statement
For learners, creators, and institutions who want proof that watching leads to understanding, LearnStamp is the timestamp‑first, crowdsourced quiz layer that mints verifiable proof‑of‑understanding on U2U—unlike generic comments, likes, or passive metrics.

### 1.5 Brand values
- Clarity over hype
- Evidence over opinion
- Community over isolation
- Accessibility over exclusivity
- Privacy and integrity by default

## 2) Audience & Outcomes

- Learners: gain clarity at confusing moments; earn portable stamps of understanding.
- Creators: see confusion hotspots, pass rates, and concept maps to improve videos.
- Institutions: verify micro‑competencies and align to course or policy rails.
- Developers: integrate stamps and analytics via SDKs, subgraphs, and contracts.

Primary outcomes: comprehension gains, trustworthy proof, faster content iteration.

## 3) Messaging Pillars

1) Timestamp‑first  
- Micro‑checks occur where confusion happens.  
- Copy anchor: “moments that matter,” “right when it clicks.”

2) Crowd‑refined clarity  
- Questions are proposed, edited, and ranked by the community.  
- Copy anchor: “crowd‑refined,” “best‑in‑video checkpoints.”

3) Verifiable proof  
- Correct answers mint non‑transferable stamps on U2U.  
- Copy anchor: “portable proof‑of‑understanding,” “audit‑friendly.”

4) Creator analytics  
- Hotspots, StampRate, and StampGraph inform edits and series planning.  
- Copy anchor: “confusion hotspots,” “concept graph,” “pass rate trends.”

5) U2U scale  
- Fast, parallel writes; EVM compatibility; optional subnets.  
- Copy anchor: “real‑time scale,” “smooth UX,” “future‑proof rails.”

Use 2–3 pillars per asset; never cram all five.

## 4) Voice & Tone

- Voice: confident, concise, human; edu‑first, crypto‑neutral.
- Tone by context:
  - Product UI: direct, supportive, minimal.
  - Docs: precise, stepwise, example‑first.
  - Social: curious, outcome‑led, no jargon.
  - Investor/partner: strategic, metric‑ready, risk‑aware.

Do:
- Prefer short, active sentences.
- Explain blockchain outcomes, not jargon.
- Lead with user outcomes, then mechanics.

Avoid:
- Token price/speculation.
- Buzzwords: “revolutionary,” “paradigm‑shifting,” “magic.”
- Over‑promising learning guarantees.

Style:
- Use “you” for users, “we” for LearnStamp.
- Oxford comma.
- Spell out acronyms on first use.

## 5) Naming & Terminology

- Product: LearnStamp (capitalize L and S).
- Units & verbs:
  - Stamp (noun): the non‑transferable proof artifact.
  - Stamping (verb): the act of answering and minting proof.
- Features:
  - StampBook (learner profile)
  - StampGraph (concept map)
  - StampRate (pass rate metric)
  - Checkpoint (timestamped quiz card)
  - Creator Dashboard
  - Extension Overlay
  - ProofLayer (SDK/contracts module)
- Capitalization: Title Case for product/features; sentence case in UI labels unless proper noun.
- Hyphenation: timestamped (adj.), on‑chain (adj.).
- Disallowed: coin/points implying speculation; “certificate” unless context requires.

## 7) Visual Identity Rules (summary; details in design-system.md)

Logo
- Primary: LearnStamp wordmark with stamp‑mark icon.
- Clear space: ≥ 0.5× logo height on all sides.
- Minimum sizes: digital 24px height; print 10mm height.
- Backgrounds: prefer solid high‑contrast; avoid photo noise.

Color
- Keep AA contrast minimum (WCAG 2.1).
- Reserve brand accent for key actions and stamp states.
- Never rely on color alone to convey correctness.

Typography
- One sans family with clear weights; limit to 2 weights in UI (e.g., Regular, Semibold).
- Sentence case in UI labels.

Imagery
- Show UI moments: timestamped checks, answer feedback, concept links.
- Avoid “crypto clipart”; use product‑led visuals.

Motion
- Fast, purposeful micro‑interactions (<200ms).
- Ease curves: standard ease‑out for affirmations; subtle attention cues.

---

## 8) Accessibility

- Contrast: text/background ≥ 4.5:1 (body) and ≥ 3:1 (large text).
- Focus: visible focus rings; keyboard navigable flows.
- Color: never encode correctness only by color; pair with icon/text.
- Alt text: describe the “stamp at timestamp” concept where present.
- Language: plain language, avoid idioms.

---

## 9) Compliance & Legal

- “Stamp” is a branded term here; avoid genericizing.
- Reference U2U neutrally; link to docs when technical claims are made.
- Data: do not imply personal data is on‑chain; only proof artifacts/refs.
- Third‑party: YouTube is a trademark of Google; describe as “works with YouTube via overlay.”
