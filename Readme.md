# LearnStamp — U2U-powered social learning for every video

LearnStamp is a crowdsourced, timestamped quiz layer for YouTube and short-form educational videos that turns passive watching into verifiable “proof-of-understanding” stamped on-chain, tailored for U2U’s DAG + EVM to showcase real-time scale and AI-assisted learning at hackathon-grade polish.[^1][^2]

### Problem

Educational videos are hard to trust and measure: studies show wide variance in quality and reliability, forcing teachers and learners to spend time validating content rather than learning.  Crowdsourced checks and open innovation systematically improve instructional resources but lack verifiable provenance and incentives across platforms.  YouTube’s scale demands a lightweight, social, and portable layer that verifies learning effectiveness at the moment of viewing.[^2][^3][^4][^5][^6][^7]

### Solution

LearnStamp lets viewers drop “learning stamps” at exact timestamps by creating or answering short questions, surfacing the community’s best checkpoints in-video while minting non-transferable proof-of-understanding credentials on U2U.  AI proposes draft questions and clarifications from transcripts, while the crowd upvotes, refines, and verifies the best ones to build a living concept map per video and per topic.  The result is a self-improving, verifiable layer for social learning that travels with the content and its community.[^4][^8][^9][^10][^11][^1]

### Why U2U

U2U’s DAG-based Layer-1 with EVM compatibility supports high-throughput, low-latency micro-interactions (answers, votes, stamps) at scale, ideal for millions of concurrent learning events.  Its modular architecture and subnets enable dedicated learning rails for institutions or partners without sacrificing mainnet settlement and ecosystem reach.  The hackathon explicitly targets EVM-deployable MVPs and rewards real user impact, making LearnStamp a strong SocialFi + AI fit.[^12][^13][^14][^15][^1]

### Core user flow

- Watch a video, and see the top community “stamps” appear at relevant timestamps as optional micro-quizzes or clarifications.[^8][^2]
- Answer to verify understanding; correct answers mint a non-transferable “Stamp” NFT tied to the concept and video segment on U2U.[^14][^1]
- Create new questions when something is unclear; the crowd refines and ranks them, building a concept graph and difficulty map for future learners.[^4][^8]


### What makes it brilliant and simple

- Timestamp-first: tiny, focused checks precisely where confusion happens, not after the video.[^3][^8]
- Crowd-improves content: unclear parts attract more clarifying questions, naturally ranking videos by learning effectiveness.[^2][^4]
- Verifiable learning: on-chain stamps form a portable, audit-friendly proof-of-understanding trail for learners and creators.[^14][^1]


### AI integration

- Auto-suggest questions and distractors from transcripts and chapters; the crowd edits and approves, keeping AI as a draft assistant.[^9][^10]
- Summarize confusion hotspots by clustering high-failure stamps, giving creators targeted fix suggestions.[^3][^2]
- Personalized practice pulls similar stamps across videos to reinforce weak concepts.[^16][^9]


### SocialFi mechanics

- Streaks and topic badges reward consistent learning, not speculation, encouraging healthy, repeatable engagement.[^17][^18]
- Leaderboards by concept and course playlists surface community experts and helpful explainers.[^19][^20]
- Creators get learning analytics they can’t access today, driving organic adoption and sharing with their audiences.[^21][^2]


### U2U architecture

- Smart contracts (Solidity) for Stamp SBTs, reputation scores, and checkpoint registries deployed on U2U’s EVM.[^1][^14]
- High-frequency writes (answers/upvotes) benefit from DAG’s parallel processing and fast finality for a smooth UX.[^13][^15]
- Optional subnets for campuses or enterprise partners with custom policies while anchoring proofs to U2U mainnet.[^12][^14]


### Track fit and judging

- Innovation: reimagines video learning with verifiable, timestamped peer assessment native to Web3 rails.[^15][^1]
- Practicality: frictionless overlay and browser extension; works with existing YouTube behaviors and study groups.[^22][^23]
- UX: optional, low-friction checks that enrich—not interrupt—watching, guided by proven gamification patterns.[^9][^17]
- Technical: demonstrates DAG-scale micro-interactions, EVM contracts, and AI-assisted content with verifiable on-chain outcomes.[^13][^14]
- U2U integration: highlights DAG, EVM, subnets, and aligns with SocialFi + AI tracks and hackathon criteria.[^15][^1]


### Demo plan

- Live browser extension overlay on selected YouTube educational videos with stamping, answering, and minting live on U2U testnet/mainnet.[^24][^1]
- Creator dashboard showing confusion hotspots, stamp pass rates, and concept graphs.[^2][^3]
- Learner profile displaying on-chain stamps and topic mastery across videos.[^14][^1]


### Documentation

- README covering goals, feature set, and SocialFi + AI positioning, with step-by-step U2U deployment instructions and RPC config.[^24][^1]
- Architecture notes: contracts, indexer flow, AI pipeline, and how DAG characteristics informed design decisions.[^13][^14]


### Pitch (100–300 words)

LearnStamp transforms educational videos into social, verifiable learning by letting viewers drop and answer timestamped “stamps” that certify understanding on U2U’s DAG + EVM.  The crowd collaboratively curates the best micro-quizzes at the exact moments confusion occurs, while AI drafts suggestions that learners refine and approve, creating a living, high-signal concept graph per video and topic.  For creators, LearnStamp surfaces precise confusion hotspots and pass rates they cannot get today, enabling targeted improvements and stronger community engagement.  U2U’s high-throughput, fast-finality architecture powers millions of bite-sized interactions without lag, and subnets open paths for schools and enterprises to run custom rails while anchoring proofs on mainnet.  The result is a simple, brilliant layer that lets anyone learn together—and prove it—turning passive viewing into collective understanding at internet scale.[^8][^21][^1][^4][^9][^13][^14][^2]

### GTM and growth

- Seed with mid-tier edu creators who gain unique learning analytics and community kudos.[^7][^21]
- University study groups adopt LearnStamp for shared checkpoints and portable proof-of-understanding.[^23][^22]
- Align with U2U’s grants, mentorship, and PR to onboard SocialFi + AI partners.[^25][^1]


### Milestones and KPIs

- Week 1: U2U deploy, 5 pilot channels, 1K stamps minted, <2s stamp-to-proof latency.[^15][^1]
- Month 1: 50K answers, 5K unique learners, 200 creator dashboards activated.[^21][^14]
- Month 3: Subnet pilot with an education partner for policy-controlled rails.[^12][^14]
